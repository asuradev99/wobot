- Equalizer support (bass boost and other effects)
- Lavalink sadly can't support tracks from Spotify; however, it would be possible to get track playlists from Spotify and other sources and see if similar video sources on youtube. So, playlists & spotify links is a potential target
- Command options/flags
- Queue commands (Loop, clear, shuffle, remove range, move tracks)
- Save/load local playlists?
- Lyrics API
- Seek to position in song
